Graphael is the definitive, single source of truth for software composition and
a proactive defense mechanism for the software supply chain for your
organisation.

## Features

### :white_check_mark: System of record for software components

Single source of truth for software composition.

### :white_check_mark: Supply chain firewall

A proactive defense mechanism for the software supply chain, due to its ability
to mirror dependencies and enforce policies, differentiating it from pure SCA or
ARO tools.

### :white_check_mark: Powerful policy engine

A highly configurable and extensible policy engine that allows organizations to
define granular rules for component usage, security posture, and license
compliance across all stages of the SDLC. This is a core capability that drives
enterprise adoption and effective risk management.

### :white_check_mark: Advanced risk prioritization using AI

Intelligent and contextualized risk prioritization based on the analysis of vast
amounts of component, dependency, and vulnerability data.

### :white_check_mark: Comprehensive ecosystem integrations

We will build a marketplace for integrations with popular SCM, CI/CD, security
testing, and project management tools to ensure a seamless integration into
existing DevOps pipelines.

### :white_check_mark: Web console for management and visualization

An intuitive, visual, and actionable user interface to visualize dependencies,
significantly reducing the learning curve and drive user engagement.

### :white_check_mark: Comprehensive compliance reporting

Out-of-the-box reports for common compliance standards and detailed audit logs
for policy enforcement.

### :white_check_mark: Open source core

Altough we also plan to offer a commercial version, we intend to keep the
largest part of the development effort focused the community variant of the
application, developed in the open and released under the business friendly
Apache 2.0 License.

## Editions

The application is in an early stage of development. Because of that, we are
focusing for the moment solely on the free and open source community version.
We plan to extend our offering to include paid versions of the application,
for both the cloud version and the on-premise variant.
